# Convert Text-to-Speech with Google's TTS

In this Notebook, I explore gTTS - the Google's Text-to-Speech engine. It writes text data to a mp3 file. I show a very simple example, inspired by an article in Towards Data Science.
The same Notebook is published on my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/anetakovacheva/text-to-speech-with-gtts) page, where Audio buttons are displayed and the texts could be heard.
